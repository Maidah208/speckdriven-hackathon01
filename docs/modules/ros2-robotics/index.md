# ROS 2 Robotics Education Module

Welcome to the ROS 2 Robotics Education Module! This module is designed for robotics and AI students focusing on physical AI systems. You'll learn about middleware for humanoid robot control via ROS 2.

## About this Module

This educational module covers:

1. **ROS 2 Basics**: Understanding nodes, topics, and services
2. **Agent Integration**: Bridging Python agents to ROS 2 controllers
3. **URDF for Humanoid Robots**: Understanding robot description format

Each section is designed to be modular and independently accessible, allowing you to learn at your own pace.

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have:
- Basic programming knowledge (especially Python)
- Fundamental understanding of robotics concepts (robot structure, sensors, actuators)

If you're new to robotics, we recommend starting with the ROS 2 Basics chapter to build a solid foundation.
