# LLM Planning Architecture Diagram

This diagram illustrates the LLM-based cognitive planning architecture with ROS 2 integration showing:

1. Natural Language Input
2. LLM Processing and Reasoning
3. Action Sequence Generation
4. ROS 2 Action Execution
5. Environmental Feedback Loop
6. Plan Adaptation and Improvement

The diagram shows how high-level goals are translated into executable robot actions through LLM reasoning.
