# ROS 2 Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 Nervous System! This comprehensive guide covers the fundamentals of ROS 2 for humanoid robot control, designed for robotics and AI students focusing on physical AI systems.

## About This Book

This educational resource is designed to help you understand and work with ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software. The book is structured into three comprehensive modules:

1. **ROS 2 Basics**: Understanding nodes, topics, and services
2. **Agent Integration**: Bridging Python agents to ROS 2 controllers
3. **URDF for Humanoid Robots**: Understanding robot description format

Each module is designed to be modular and independently accessible, allowing you to learn at your own pace.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this book:

1. Start with the first module if you're new to ROS 2
2. Each module includes practical examples and exercises
3. Complete the exercises to reinforce your learning
4. Use the additional resources for deeper understanding

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (especially Python)
- Fundamental understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command line operations

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between different modules and chapters. Each chapter builds on the previous knowledge while remaining as self-contained as possible to allow flexible learning paths.

Let's begin your journey into ROS 2 robotics programming!
